FAQ.jsx documents the Free/Premium tier split: Free users get 2 Claude (Premium) + 3 Basic recipes/hr; Premium gets 5 Claude + 10 Basic recipes/hr plus continent cuisine preferences. Home.jsx links directly to App Store (id6761888929) and Google Play (com.toifood.app) with "Free to download" copy clearly set. Platform billing (App Store/Google Play) provides external refund and cancellation infrastructure. The value differential between tiers is clearly communicated in the FAQ.
