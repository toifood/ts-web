Home.jsx feature grid confirms five shipped pillars: AI recipe generation (Basic + Premium tiers), pantry/grocery ingredient match, cloud-backed save-and-revisit, YouTube video pairing per recipe, and dietary preference filtering. SharedRecipe.jsx demonstrates a complete public share flow: ingredients, steps, cook-time, servings, dietary tags, continent cuisine, meal type, and author card — all rendered live from the API. App Store (id6761888929) and Google Play (com.toifood.app) listings are live. Web stack: React 18 + Vite + React Router v6 deployed to Cloudflare Pages (wrangler.toml, _redirects). Cloudflare Functions handle recipe token routing (`frontend/functions/recipe/[token].js`).
