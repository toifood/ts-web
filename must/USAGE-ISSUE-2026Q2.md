1. **Limits not contractually disclosed** — FAQ.jsx documents hourly generation limits (Free: 2 Claude + 3 Basic; Premium: 5 Claude + 10 Basic) but Terms.jsx is silent on usage limits. Users have no contractual notice that limits exist or can be changed.
2. **Public endpoint silent on failure** — SharedRecipe.jsx calls `https://api.toifood.co.nz/recipes/public/${token}` and `/users/${userId}/profile` with no retry-after handling or quota feedback. Rate-limit errors from the backend collapse silently into the generic error state ("Recipe not found"), obscuring the real cause from users.
3. **No quota visibility** — No web-facing usage dashboard or remaining-quota indicator exists for authenticated users on the marketing site.
